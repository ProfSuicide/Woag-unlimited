Upon entering the Inn, the player is confronted by a very attractive looking female human. 
“Hey there sweetie, I’m Jaina. I’m the owner of this inn, ‘The Gilded Rose’. 
We can’t thank you enough for helping us save the princess. You look exhausted! 
Here tonights room is on the house and I’ll bring up some food and drink to make sure you are 
well rested for tomorrow's journey. It would be best for you to get an early start on this journey 
as it is a long walk to the castle. I wouldn’t recommend going to bed until you’re done around town. 
So what do you say? Are you ready to rest your eyes a bit?”
