You wake up well rested and get ready to set out on your journey. As you walk down the road leaving the town you 
notice everyone is standing outside watching you leave you turn back to wave goodbye to everyone and as you're 
waving you notice out of the corner of your eye what you think is the Duke watching you from one of the windows 
of the inn but as you look closer you realize no one is there. You turn and continue on your journey. After several 
hours of walking you come upon this huge castle that seems to be very well hidden within the woods. As you enter the 
courtyard a black ball of smoke suddenly appears and as the smoke dissipates there's a man standing there in 
an all black robe with red eyes.
