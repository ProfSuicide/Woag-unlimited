The player is greeted by a short and very hairy dwarf with a huge beard. 
"Aye! I've heard the good news. You're here to help us save the princess. 
My name is Grimbow and I can't begin to tell you how grateful we are for 
you to help us get this Dagan the Duke out of our town! He strolls into 
town a fortnite ago and demands free food and shelter along with help 
saving the princess. I don't know why everyone is so ready and willing 
to help him but there's something that I don't like about him. 
I am ready to get this crooked-nosed knave of a duke out of my town! 
If you're willing to help us save the princess so that he leaves 
I would gladly give ye one of my weapons for free. I have this nicely 
balanced sword and shield, these straight and true bow and arrows, or 
this magical stone that I won in a game of dice. So which will it be?'
