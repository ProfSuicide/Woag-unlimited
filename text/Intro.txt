, a very successful bounty hunter and monster slayer that roams from town to town is now searching for a 
new town to find work at. You see a small town in the distance and draw closer to it hoping to find work so that you may pay to 
resupply your food and drink. Upon coming closer to the town you see a sign that says 'Stratusberg' which you assume must be the 
name of the town. Upon entering the town you notice a very nicely dressed man running towards you.
